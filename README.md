# SpotifyAd-block
Ad blocking

For windows, try searching up EZBlocker online
I do not hold any responsibility if this method mess up your system this is just a interesting way to see how to block ads.
------ FOR MAC ---------

First thing to do is downgrade your spodify, the new version is very clever about getting around most ad blocking methods.

I would suggest getting 1.0.12.xxx first

1. First quit your spotify, then uninstall it by going in your application folder and dragging spotify into the trash and clearing it.

2. Then go into finder, press "shift", "command" and "g" together and paste in "/private/etc/hosts" and press enter.

3. Right click hosts, then get info, and go to permissions and give read and write permission to everything.

4. Then drag the hosts file out to desktop by pressing "command" to make sure you are not making a copy.

5. right click on the file to open it with text edit and paste the below address into it.

6. then save the file and drag the file back to its orginal folder the same way.

7. Then download the spotify from the link up top and install it. 

If now there shouldn't be any ads anymore.
if you still see ads, try quitting spotify and going into applications in finder and rightclick show contents for spotify then go into contents/resources/apps and delete ad.spa.
